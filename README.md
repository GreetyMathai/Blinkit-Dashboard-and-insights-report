This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales, outlet performance, and customer buying behavior using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis focuses on understanding regional trends, outlet efficiency, and product preferences to support data-driven retail decisions.

## Objectives
- Compare sales across city tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
- Evaluate performance by outlet size and outlet type
- Identify top-performing product categories and fat content preferences
- Analyze outlet expansion trends over time

## Dataset Summary
Product-level data: Item category, fat content, visibility, rating, sales
Outlet-level data: Outlet size, outlet type, location tier, establishment year

## Charts Used
- KPI Cards: Display high-level business metrics such as Total Sales, Total Items Sold, Average Rating, and Average Sales per Item. These provide a quick snapshot of overall performance.

- Bar Charts: Used to compare sales across location tiers, outlet sizes, outlet types, and product categories. These charts help identify top-performing regions, store formats, and high-demand categories at a glance.

- Donut Charts: Represent proportional distributions such as Low-Fat vs Regular-Fat product preference and outlet type contribution to total sales, making it easy to understand market share and customer preferences.

- Stacked Column Charts: Show how multiple dimensions interact, such as outlet size performance across city tiers and category-wise sales within each tier, enabling deeper comparative analysis.

- Line Chart: Visualizes outlet establishment trends over time, highlighting expansion phases, peak growth years, and periods of saturation across tiers.

- Tables / Matrix Visuals: Provide detailed views of sales, ratings, and visibility metrics by outlet type, supporting granular analysis and validation of high-level trends.

## Key Insights Generated
- Tier 3 is the highest-performing and fastest-growing region.
- Low-Fat products consistently outperform Regular-Fat items.
